# FileEncryptionSendReceive
Repository for a program that performs a key exchange through a "Key Distribution Center" process to Amal (the sender process) and Basim (the receiver process). Once Amal and Basim receive the symetric session keys, Amal encrypts and sends its message to Basim via pipe, where Basim receives and decrypts the message.
